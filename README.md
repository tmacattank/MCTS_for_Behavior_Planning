# Decision-making in Autonomous Driving using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

This repository contains the code, datasets, and supplementary materials related to our research paper on leveraging MCTS for decision-making in autonomous vehicles. 

## Abstract

We present a comprehensive framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search for decision-making in autonomous driving scenarios. Through extensive simulations in MATLAB's autonomous driving toolbox, we showcase the framework's efficacy across various driving conditions, from intricate urban intersections to highway exits. While our simulations demonstrate promising results, we highlight areas for potential improvement and suggest future research directions.
